I'm a data professional, always teaching or learning something.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my new Udemy courses about SQL and regular expressions.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQLite and Jupyter notebooks.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my courses
- ğŸ˜„ Quote: if you can't explain it simply you don't understand it well enough.
